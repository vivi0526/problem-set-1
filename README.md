# Problem Set 1

| **Due**: 5pm on Feb 9 

## Workflow

1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking].
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your
solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. Make corrections until the Travis CI build status icon changes to green
/ passing
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to

For each problem, you should use simple Unix commands to arrive at the
correct answer.  Put all your work in a `run.sh` file that generates
a `answers.yml` file.

```
# ansewer.yml should look like this:
answer-1: 123
answer-2: 456
```

## Example Problem

Which state has the highest popultion?
```
# zcat == gzcat on Linux
high_pop=$(gzcat states.tab.gz | cut -f1,2 | sort -k2n | tail -n1 | cut -f1)
echo "answer-example: $high_pop
```

Each problem below is worth **5 points**. Use the files in the `data-sets`
repository.

## Question 1

Which state in `states.tab.gz` has the lowest murder rate?

## Question 2

How many sequence records are in the `sample.fa` file?

## Question 3

How many unique CpG IDs are in `cpg.bed.gz`?

## Question 4

How many sequence records are in the `SP1.fq` file?

## Question 5

How many words are on lines containing the word `bloody` in `hamlet.txt`? (Hint:
use `wc` to count words).

## Question 6

What is the length of the sequence in the first record of `sample.fa`?
(Hint: use `wc` to count characters).

## Question 7

What is the name of the longest gene in `genes.hg19.bed.gz`?

## Question 8

How many unique chromosomes are in `genes.hg19.bed.gz`?


## Question 9

How many intervals are associated with CTCF in `peaks.chr22.bed.gz`?

## Question 10
